      <h1>Healthy granola with chunky chunks<br>
crunchy and chewy granola filled with nuts and seeds</h1>
<p>Do you like granola with big crispy pieces and not too sweet? Well, this healthy granola is for you!<br> With the sweet flavor of our whey protein caramel and a handful of rolled oats and nuts for the crunch.<br> The secret to making chunky granola is to stir egg whites into the oats, which helps them bind together<br> into bigger chunks while baking.<br> You can also break the granola into whatever size pieces you like! If you don't like nuts/seeds, feel free to leave them out.<br> If you like things a little sweeter, try tossing a handful of dried fruit into the granola after it's been baked.</p>
<h2>PREPARATION</h2>
<p>1.Preheat the oven to 140Â°C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>
2.Combine oats, nuts/seeds, protein and salt in a bowl.<br>
3.In a medium jug or bowl, combine applesauce/banana, maple syrup and egg whites. Melt the coconut oil and mix everything together. Pour into the bowl with the oat mixture and stir until everything is completely coated.<br>
4.Sprinkle the mixture on the plate and press it to obtain a thin layer of granola.<br>
5.Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the tray 180 degrees and return to the oven for 15 minutes. Rotate another 180 degrees and return to the oven for another 15 minutes.<br>
6.Remove the tray from the oven and break the granola into pieces (choose whatever size you want them to be). Mix the pieces on the tray and spread out in an even layer, then return to the oven for the last 15 minutes.<br>
7.Remove from oven and let cool completely - it will crisp up as it cools. Transfer to an airtight jar and store at room temperature for up to 1 month.<br>
8.Enjoy!</p>
